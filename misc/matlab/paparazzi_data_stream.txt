paparazzi data stream

1. open port on listening machine (where you want to plot data), e.g.:
nc -v -l -p 1234 > ~/Desktop/realtime_sumo.data

2. conncet GCS (e.g via ethernet) to listening machine and stream data: 
tail --lines=100 -f ~/paparazzi/var/logs/18_02_05__00_00_00.data | pv -b | nc -v 10.42.43.1 1234

3. run realtime_plot_sumo.m in matlab (cancel when you want to start a new plot or done)

Troubleshooting:
- you might have to change nc to netcat depending on which you have installed
- works also via wifi - just check the ip (ifconfig) on the listening machine 
- if the incoming connection is blocked by the firewall add a new rule: sudo ufw allow in 1234/tcp
